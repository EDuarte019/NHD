           <h2>Marisela</h2>
           <p>A girl lived in Guadalajara with her family. Her father got killed due to the criminals. Therefore, her
               mom
               wanted to move to the United States so that they could live in a safer place. Consequently, she came to
               America
               and became to police officer to help fight crime. This relates to triumph because she achieved what she
               was
               hoping and they also fight her her father. This is also tyranny because her father died due to living
               in an
               unsafe home. </p>

           <h2>Peter</h2>
           <p>
               Peter came to the U.S. in 1965 in the freighter ship crossing the pacific. His parents sought for a
               better
               life. During his time, he made lots of friends and met a lot o people. He graduated from college, in
               the
               medical field. He went on to treat cancer patients by developing drugs that are still used today. This
               proves
               to show how not all immigrants are bad and some even change a country they are not from. Clearly, the
               immigration act was a right step.

           <h2>Emily Gonzalez</h2>
           <p>At the age of 13, her father was in jail size moths. After, they decided to deport him to Mexico. Due to
               that,
               the family followed along back to Mexico to stay united. Now, they are struggling for money and food.
               Especially difficult to get a job. This is like the story in many people, families struggle to stay
               together
               because their families are being deported back and they have start over once again.</p>

           <h2>Vicky</h2>
           <p>Vicky came to the U.S. in 2005. She got pregnant and went back to inform the father. Years later, her
               daughter
               was going to visit her father but they denied the motherâ€™s entry preventing her to see her father. They
               would
               not speak to her due to not knowing English which was more difficult to obtain a visa. This shows
               tyranny
               in
               not having the right to have a better life and discriminated for not knowing a language. </p>

           <h2>Bahareh</h2>
           <p>
               Baharah was two years og age when he migrated to the United States after the Iraq war had began. His
               parents
               brought him to the U.S. for a better life but most of his family died due to the war. He says being in
               the
               U.S.
               helped him appreciate life. The tyranny in this is having to leave his home and having his family pass
               away.
               The triumph is due to him having a better life.

           <h2>Alberto</h2>
           <p>The brother of Alberto was born in Peru and came to the U.S. at the age of ten, he was incarcerated at
               the
               age
               of eighteen, he did a six year sentence and is facing deportation. This shows the tyranny in being
               afraid
               to
               make a mistake because you may be deported. People risk their lives everyday with the fear of being
               caught.

           <h2>Jose</h2>
           <p>Jose came to the United States when he was five years old. When he found out he was an illegal immigrant
               at
               the
               age of fifteen, it scared him from the idea of getting a job. Applying for school was especially
               difficult
               due
               to being afraid of deportation. He is now twenty four and claims life is only getting more difficult

           <h2>Mohammad</h2>
           <p>Mohammad was apart from his kids for four years. He applied for a visa. Later, he was approved. Except,
               he
               needed a sponsor but he had no one so the visa could not progress. So, he felt discriminated for being
               Muslim.
               The tyranny is bad because he earned his visa and not his fault he was denied.</p>
